## 🧭 Introduction

This is my personal **developer portfolio**, designed to be more than just a website —  
it’s a story about learning, building, and imagining what’s next in Artificial Intelligence.

I wanted to create a space that represents both my **technical depth** and **creative curiosity**.  
Everything from the **cinematic hero section** to the **Cosmic AI chatbot** reflects who I am —  
someone who enjoys turning complex problems into elegant, working solutions.

Built with **React + Vite**, powered by **Framer Motion**, and styled through **Tailwind CSS**,  
this portfolio is my home on the internet to showcase my projects, skills, and journey.
